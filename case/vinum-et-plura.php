                            For the 1st phase of my associate degree program in Digital Design, I had to spend 21 days converting what I had seen at school into a real professional work environment.
                            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomassergeant/" target="_blank">Tomas Sergeant</a>, my supervisor, gave me the opportunity to try to solve all kinds of challenging tasks independently in a professional working environment as a digital design intern. These instructive tasks sharpened both my graphic and technical skills. 
                            One of my main tasks was the rebranding of C-Holidays to Belcoast Holidays.

                                <p>
                                    After my supervisor came out of a meeting with the owner of Belcoast Holidays (formerly C-Holidays), he gave me a short briefing and a document listing the specific changes I needed to make to the website. Otherwise, I was given the freedom to experiment with the provided colors and layout myself.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The intention was not to design a completely new website but to give the existing C-Holidays website a newer, fresher look. The goal was to achieve this by copying the existing C-Holidays website and experimenting with the template elements to create something new using the new branding.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <h3 class="tag-line">Discovery and conducting a small research analysis.</h3>
                                <p>
                                The target audience of the website is mainly older citizens, families, and tourists from neighboring countries looking for a small vacation by renting a holiday house or apartment at an affordable price.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                One of the most important tasks in this project was implementing the new booking feature and integrating it with the new Belcoast Holidays website, allowing users to book directly from the site.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                The technology stack hasn't changed; the current C-Holidays website was built by modifying a template that was constructed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I proposed updating the Bootstrap version that the website was using, but this would require many modifications and might break certain functionalities. Additionally, we didn't have much time, so we decided to continue working with the current Bootstrap version.
                                </p>

                                <h2>Design, style guide and prototyping</h2>
                                <p>
                                The goal of this phase was to determine the information architecture of the website by designing a sitemap and creating a style guide with colors, typography, and the logo. This was followed by designing a mockup to visualize the user interface and converting it into a fully functional prototype to test the user experience.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Since we were rebranding a website built using a template, many design tasks were not required. The information architecture didn't change much; I only needed to apply the new branding and add a few pages. All of this was done directly by modifying the template itself, so it wasn't necessary to design and build a prototype.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <div class="media-text">

                                <h3 class="tag-line">Applying the new branding design</h3>
                                <p>
                                Because the new brand guide was provided, I didn't had to redesign the entire brand my self. It was also not necessary to create mockups to visualize how the website would look like, because I could directly apply this on the website self. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                The sitemap hadn't changed much, I only need to add a few pages for the Zeegalm and West Bay holiday domains. The webpages were new so I had to structre the pages with some available HTML elements from the existing template. 
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <p>
                                By directly applying the new design on the website we could immediately see how the website would look like and function. This made it easy to test and experiment different approaches and adjust the design to the users needs.

                                <p>
                                After a few iterations, we were satisfied with the final design and could now translate the content so that it is available in multiple languages.

                                <p>
                                Since we were modifying a template, we could easily combine the design and development phases into one, which also made it easier to experiment, test, and iterate.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                Once all the pages were designed, built, tested, translated, and the minor feedback from the project owner was applied, the website was ready for deployment.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                By making adjustments to an older codebase, changing the complete design, and integrating a bookings module, this was my first big project, which I am very proud of!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                I learned a lot during my time at Flow Hospitality Group, and I am forever grateful for the trust and opportunity they gave me. Belcoast Holidays is now online, and you can see the results live for yourself.
